Ever had that client that just can't quite grasp the bigger picture when you're building a site for them? **Filler** is a very simple Joomla! 1.5 extension that allows you to quickly add temporary menu items with meaningful text and/or images in order to help you demonstrate the structure of a completed site.

Then, when you're ready, simply edit the **Filler** menu item and change its type.

This tool is a must for any site designer.

## Installing and Upgrading

Download the extension package using the link above.

Log into the Joomla 1.5 Administrator.

Select _Extensions -\> Install/Unistall_ from the menubar.

Click _Browse_ and select the extension package from where you downloaded it onto your computer.

Click _Upload & Install File_ (alternatively use the other installation methods available if desired).

> Before upgrading it is always good practice to backup your web site files and database. It is also a good idea to test the upgrade on a copy of your web site.

To upgrade to a new version of the extension just repeat the steps above with the new package when it becomes available.  **You do not need to uninstall the extension first.** Just install the new version over the top of the existing one.

## Creating a Filler Page

Filler installs as a component that you can add as a menu item.

From the Administrator menubar, hover over _Menus_ then select the menu that you want to add a filler page to.

Click the _New_ button in the toolbar.

Click the _Filler_ link under the _Internal Link_ heading.

Fill out the general menu settings in the normal way.  This menu page has the following basic parameters that allow you to customise the page.

**Comment**

This is a comment you can enter to show on the page.  This could be as simple as "Site Map will go here" or you could add a cropped graphic image from your designer that would show what the page might look like.

**Show Under Construction**

This option simply allows you to show the text "Under Construction" on the page.

## Changing the Filler Page to a Real Page

If you are using Filler pages to preview a conceptual design to a customer, you will eventually get to the point where you have to start building out the site properly.  Changing the filler pages is easy.  Just edit the menu item and then click on the _Change Type_ button and select the appropriate component as normal.

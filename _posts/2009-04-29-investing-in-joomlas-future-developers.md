The Google Summer of Code has been a very reliable source for raising new developers and contributors for the [Joomla][0] project.  It's that time again in 2009 for Summer of Code to begin and Joomla has been granted 18 student projects amounting to a direct and indirect investment of US$90,000 from Google.  To further the investment in the project, [New Life in IT][1] has donated a subscription to [The Art of Joomla Developer Reference][2] to each Summer of Code student to assist them in their respective projects (nearly AU$900 in value).  The Art of Joomla Developer Reference is a growing, online resource of technical documentation that teaches developers and designers the art of building Joomla extensions.  Fostering the future generation of Joomla developers and leaders is an important part of why Joomla has become the most popular Content Management System in the world.

New Life in IT wishes to express its thanks to Grant Weyer and Damian Hickey, owners of [ZacWare][0], for also rising to the occasion and sponsoring us for two more whole days of Joomla 1.6 development.  This follows on from [Brett Hooker's sponsorship][1] this week which greatly assisted in the refactoring of, and adding new features to, the Joomla 1.6 Menu Manager.  Thank you ZacWare.

If you are in a position to financial sponsor Joomla 1.6 development days through either [New Life][2] or other key Joomla developers, please [contact us][3] or Ryan Ozimek from [Open Source Matters][4].


You can also support New Life in IT by purchasing a documentation subscription at [www.theartofjoomla.com][5] (the best online Joomla Developer reference available).

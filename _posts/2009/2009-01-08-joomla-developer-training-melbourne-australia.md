As a part of the [**Joomla Day in Melbourne**][0], Australia, Andrew Eddie will be running a **workshop for Joomla developers** (seats are limited and filling fast!).  Joomla 1.5 has been built with the developer in mind and affords an incredible degree of freedom for customisation.  The participant will receive an overview of the new Joomla Framework that ships with Joomla 1.5, how it is laid out and what is relevant to the developer on a day to day basis.  Each extension type will be look at from a high level, particularly the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is used in Component development. The use of layout overrides will be looked at in depth as a way of addressing sites with otherwise challenging expectations.

No materials will be required but a laptop with your editor of choice and a running Joomla site is desirable so you can follow along.  Basic programming skills will be required and there is an expectation that you can read programming and markup languages such as PHP, Javascript and HTML.  You should also be familiar with installation and the basic usage of Joomla to deliver Web site solutions for either yourself or others.  

This workshop will be a great introduction to developing in Joomla if you are wanting to get started (but it all looks too scary), if Joomla is mission critical to your organisation and you are wanting to go deeper supporting it, or if you are providing customisation and/or development services as a business to others.

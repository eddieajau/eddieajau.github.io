Last night I had the pleasure of being invited to attend the Christmas party of [Software Queensland](http://www.softwareqld.com.au/).  Software Queensland was established in 2004 to be an advocate and peer network for the ICT industry within Queensland, Australia.  Unbeknown to me, an inaugral medal was being awarded to an individual that demonstrated an outstanding contribution in the Queensland software industry. The feeling of amazement as my name was read out as the initial recipient of this medal - I will remember for a long time.

The award was presented by the Honorable Robert Schwarten MP, Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology, and John Vickers (pictured), Chair of Software Queensland.  The award was given as a great example of the potential that can be shown by a Queensland on the World stage with regard to my contributions to [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/).

But the surprises did not stop.

Brett Hooker of [ROARZ](http://www.roarz.com/) computing, another strong advocate and supporter of Joomla in Queensland, presented me with a Certificate of High Commendation from the 2009 Queensland [Pearcy Awards](http://www.pearcey.org.au/index.php/Awards), one of three given out to people taking a risk and making a difference in the development of the Australian Information and Communications Technology Industry.  A friend of mine, [Paul Gampe](http://au.linkedin.com/pub/paul-gampe/0/543/775), from Red Hat was presented with the overall award.  Congratulations Paul.  Well deserved.

Both of these peer-reviewed awards were an honour and encouragement to receive.  The efforts of countless individuals also stand behind these awards so I am very thankful for the support I have received from the Joomla community over the years.  My thanks also go to Software Queensland, the Pearcy Foundation and the Queensland Government for recognising that Open Source is making a real and credible difference in the world.

Among the varied criticisms of [Joomla][0] had been the lack of a directory showing what the most popular CMS in the world can do.  That changed today with the launch of the [Joomla Community Showcase][1].  The directory opens with a listing count of 109\.  Given the estimated tens of millions of sites out there, one can only guess at how quickly the directory will grow, possibly exponentially.  This will be a site to watch.  It will grow fast because it will be showing off some of the best web sites in the world and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt why Joomla is so popular.

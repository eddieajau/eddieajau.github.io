Joomla 1.0 end-of-life is approaching and it's time for developers who sitll use Joomla 1.5's legacy mode to switch over to the native API.  I've prepared a detailed cheat sheet for what is required to convert your Joomla 1.0 based extensions to run natively on Joomla 1.5: [Converting Old Extensions to Joomla 1.5][0].

The best way to upgrade is to turn the Legacy Mode plugin off and use "old way" vs "new way" format to help you track determine what code needs to be changed.

If you come across and problems or additional information that you think should be in there, by all means drop me a note about it.

In addition to the cheat sheet, I've also written a number of articles to introduce you to how to upgrade your old Joomla 1.0 based extensions:

* [Removing a Legacy: Part 1][1]
* [Removing a Legacy: Part 2][2]
* [Removing a Legacy: Part 3][3]


These articles cover the methodology for "how" to change your extensions, not just "what" to change.

Upgrading your Joomla 1.0 extensions now is the best way to prepare for being future compatible with Joomla 1.6 when it comes out.  If you are running natively on the Joomla 1.5 API now, then you will have little or maybe no modifications to make to enable your extensions to run with Joomla 1.6 (there are likely to be some small changes regarding the new Access Control layer).  The Legacy Mode is being dropped in Joomla 1.6 so it's not the time to be complacent about upskilling.

It's been a while since I attended to this site, mostly because of work or Joomla busy-ness, but I think it's about time to start things up again.  I'm repurposing this site to be a developer/customiser only resource rather than trying spread myself too thin over the whole range of Joomla topics available.  I'm also dropping the magazine style because, honestly, it's too hard for one person to write a suite of articles on a regular basis.  So bring on the blogging I say.  I'm going to prime the blog with a few old favourites from the magazine and then we'll get into an interesting article or two a month.  Well, that's the plan anyway :)

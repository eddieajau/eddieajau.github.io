Stephan Spencer provides an [SEO report card][0] on the Combat Blindness Foundation website which is a Joomla 1.0 site.  This is another example of why site owners should be moving to Joomla 1.5 if they can possibly make the investment.  The out-of-the-box SEO support is far superior and would have given this site a better chance.  But apart from that, it's intolerable that one extension developer deliberately used the meta fields for advertising.  That's really crossing the line.

If the extensions are your obstacle, then check out my cheat sheet on [converting old Joomla extensions to 1.5][1].

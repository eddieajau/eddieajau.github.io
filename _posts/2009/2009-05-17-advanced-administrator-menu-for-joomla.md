[**Advanced Administrator Menu**][0] is an extension for Joomla 1.5 that helps you reorganise your components menu.  If you have a web site that has dozens of components installed, the menu can get pretty long and disorganised.  **Advanced Administrator Menu** allows you to create new menus in which to group your components in more logical ways.  For more information see the [**Advanced Administrator Menu**][0] page at the Art of Joomla web site.

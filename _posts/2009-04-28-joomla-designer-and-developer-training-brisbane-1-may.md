In conjunction with [Joomla Day Brisbane 2009][0], [New Life in IT][1] will be running two excellent training workshops on 1 May.  There are only a few days left to secure the remaining seats for this unique training opportunity from Joomla core developer Andrew Eddie.  The morning session is everything you wanted to know about how Joomla does templating but were afraid to ask (excluding the elements of artistic design).  This session is especially tailored for people who do not know PHP well or at all.  The afternoon session is about unraveling the mysteries of the Joomla Framework as a development platform.  For more information see the [Joomla Day Brisbane synopsis][0].  Those attending either training course will also receive a **free 12-month subscription** to [The Art of Joomla Developer Reference][2].

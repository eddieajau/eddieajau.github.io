This is the slide presentation I prepared for my "Node for PHP Developers" talk that I gave at [CampJS IV](http://campjs.com).

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

The idea was to prepare the talk I wish I could have heard when I was thrown in the deep-end of doing my first Node project. It was frustrating.

I wasn't productive.

I knew what I wanted to do and no matter how hard I squeezed the stone, no blood came out.

After a long while it all started to sink in and I could see translations for the design patterns I was used to, but oh how rough the journey. Hopefully these slides help others that find myself in the situation that I've thankfully moved on from. 

For what it's worth, I believe I am now a better developer for having been exposed to Node and the principles behind JavaScript. It's become my language of choice but I am convinced that if I did move pack into writing PHP, I would write better PHP for having learned Node.

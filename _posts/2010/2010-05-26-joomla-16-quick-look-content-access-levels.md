This is a quick look at the new content access level features in Joomla 1.6\.

You can access the access level manager by selecting _Users -\>Access Levels _ from the Administrator menubar, or by clicking on the _Access Levels_ submenu link while in the User Manager.

Add a new access level by clicking the _New_ button in the toolbar.  Type in the name of the level (Joomla doesn't care what you call an access level).  Then you need to select which user groups will have the ability to see the content assigned to this access level.  In the example screenshot we see that the "Exams" access level allows access to the "Teachers" user group.  Any users in the "Teachers" user group will be able to view this content.

Access levels also apply to all other content in Joomla such as web links and contacts, as well as modules and menus.

![Andrea Tarr](/images/2010/andrea_tarr.jpg)[Andrea Tarr][3] is the designer of the Hathor accessible Administrator template. Andrea got into computers when she was a librarian back in the late 70's by taking home a self-study guide to the IBM System-32/34 and writing the first computerised circulation system in the state of New Hampshire. She currently works as an independent consultant and will shortly receive a Master of Science of Information Technology degree from the Marlboro College Graduate School so that she won't have to keep explaining why a Master of Library & Information Science degree is so valuable in the computer field.

The Hathor template layout is similar to the typical Administrator template but has been arranged to better suit screen readers.

Hathor includes a high-contrast mode for the visually impaired.

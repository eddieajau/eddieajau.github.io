Here is an overview of the toolbar changes on edit screens in Joomla 1.6\.

The _Apply_ button has been renamed to _Save_.  This button will save the current page then return to it so you can continue to work on it.

The _Save_ button has been renamed to _Save & Close_.  This button will save the current page then return you to the list managing that content.


The _Save & New_ button is new.  This button will save the current page, then return you to a new blank item, avoiding going back to the list in between.

The _Save as Copy_ button is also new.  This button will save the current page as a copy of the original, then return you to that copy so you can continue to work on it.  The original content is not changed in the process.

The _Close_ button simply returns you to the list managing the content without saving.

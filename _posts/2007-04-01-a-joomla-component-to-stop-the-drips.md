[Toowoomba City Council](http://www.toowoomba.qld.gov.au) will be launching it's Water Tracker site this week built on [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org).

This is a site where residents of Toowoomba can reigster and log their water meter readings in order to track their usage. Toowoomba is currently on Level 5 Water Restrictions which came in force when the combined dam capacity dropped below 20%.

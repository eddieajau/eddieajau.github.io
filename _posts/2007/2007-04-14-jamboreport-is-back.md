After too long an hiatus, i've given the old JamboReport project a dust off. It now has a new name, RokReporter, and home on [JoomlaCode](http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/rocketwerx/frs/).
It now comes standalone - no secondary libraries to install. There are "minor" changes to the API but nothing too serious. It will remain in Beta until I've had time to freshen the User & Developer Manual.
RokReporter runs on Joomla! 1.0.7 or above. A version for 1.5 is planned but not available at this stage.

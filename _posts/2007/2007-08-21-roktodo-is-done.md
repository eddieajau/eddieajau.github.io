**RokTodo** is a very simple Joomla! 1.5 component that allows you to add placeholder menu items with meaningful text, or images, to help you demonstrate the structure of a completed site. So if your client or boss is struggling with the link backs to the home page and being asked to imagine the big picture (we all know this doesn't go down well when trying to give the appearance of having made some progress), RokTodo is for you.

It's really simple to use. Just create a new menu item using the RokTodo Component, edit the parameters and save.

But behind the scenes this means that **RokCodeIt** for 1.5 is back up to speed for making extension install files for 1.5. That's huge - well, ok, it's still alpha but it is proceeding extremely well now. This announcement also heralds the beginning of our Joomla! 1.5 offerings. There is much more coming.

RokTodo is release under Version 2 of the GNU General Public License and is available for download for free from [joomlacode.org](http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/rocketwerx/frs/).

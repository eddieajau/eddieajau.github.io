Those following the [RocketWerx SVN](http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/rocketwerx/scmsvn/) will notice an interesting new addition: RokACL. RokACL will be a component for Joomla! 1.5 that will lay the foundations for advanced access control. It will allow you to add new user groups, your own sets of permissions and be able to assign various combinations to form Access Control Lists.

The work is currently pre-Alpha but the proof-of-concept stage has been accomplished. The component can be installed by hand (at your own risk) and the required SQL is included. RokACL will likely be rolled out in two stages. The first will be with other [RocketWerx](http://www.rocketwerx.com/) components that support it. The second stage will include the ability for all of Joomla! 1.5 to be run by RokACL with minimal "core hacks".

RokACL is intended to be a proving ground for ACL in Joomla! 1.5. It is hoped that through fast-tracked development and in-situ testing, it will be able to be donated in a mature state to the [Joomla! Project](http://www.joomla.org/) for its inclusion natively in version 1.6.

RokACL is proudly released as a Free Open Source component under the GNU General Public License.

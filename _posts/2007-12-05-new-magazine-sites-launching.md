We have two new Magazine sites launching: [BeON Living][0] and [The Art of Joomla][1].


[BeON Living][0]

This is a really nice looking lifestyle site that I did in partnership with a few other guys for Essential Living Foods.

The design is by Waseem Sadiq of [Simply Joomla][2].

Louis Landry and Rob Schley of [webImagery][3] also assited greatly during the project.

This site is built on a recent trunk version of Joomla! 1.5 and shows the power of it's template override system with almost every layout customised in some way. In addition to this, extra flexibility is gained from the Magazine's built in splash page manager which powers the home page and also the top-level menu item landing pages.

[The Art of Joomla][1]

This is my personal blog site, well, as close as I'm going to get anyway for a while. This site uses a slightly modified Versatility 2 template from [RocketTheme][4] and features my Magazine extension and my Catalog extension to underpin the directory part of the site. My hope is this will become a good teaching resource for the wider Joomla! community.

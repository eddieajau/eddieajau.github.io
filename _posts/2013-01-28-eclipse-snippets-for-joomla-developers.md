I've added a number of Eclipse snippets that I have used on a regular basis to assist with Joomla extension development. You can find them in the new **[Snippets][0]** area on this site.

If you don't know how to use snippets in Eclipse, I've made a video tutorial that will help get you started. Have a look at the **[Development Tools][1]** video on the Learn the Art of Joomla site (about half way through).

The snippets cover a number of categories and include:

* Common component code
* Code for writing backend component list pages
* Code for writing backend component edit pages
* Code for packaging your extensions

There are a number of other snippet categories that cover supporting code in components as well as modules and plugins.

For those that use Eclipse regularly for Joomla development, I think you'll find these snippets a huge time saver.

I'm really excited about a new addition to the web site. I'm starting to **[document the Protostar template][0]** that comes with Joomla 3\.

While I don't claim to be a template design guru, I do need to know how a template is structured to build a Joomla site. Late last year (2012) I decided to refresh **[www.theartofjoomla.com][1]** (long story short: I wanted to add Disqus comments; wanted to do it using JForm; JForm not available in Joomla 1.5; Joomla upgrade requried). I decided to go with Joomla 3 because it had almost everything I needed and I wanted to teach myself to use some of the new features in both Joomla 3 and the templates. However, when it came to crafting the user experience, which for me involves a lot of module switching, I had a hard time finding information for how to milk the hidden power of the new Twitter Bootstrap system in Protostar.

There simply isn't a lot of information about it (at the time of writing), certainly not in a single resource that you can refer to like you would find on any template club site. So I've decided to build a **[guide for Protostar][0]** as I learn about more about it myself. For now, it covers one of the most important parts of the template and that's the module positions. It also covers the custom module styles that come with Protostar.

There's obviously a lot more to put into the Protostar guide but if you do use it for a base, I hope the guide is a valuable bookmark for you. If you have ideas about what else you'd like to know, or have ideas about how to improve the guide, please let me know. I already have the various menu styles and typography on my list, as well as also documenting the Beez3 template in a similar fashion (I've already noticed some big differences).

Well, it's the time of the year for making plans and I thought I'd try to outline what I have in mind for the Art of Joomla this year. Both 2011 and 2012 were difficult with many life issues getting in the way. Hopefully this year will prove somewhat more productive. Anyway, here are the plans so far for this year.

## Upgrade to Joomla 3

As some might have noticed, I've spent the last few weeks upgrading this site to Joomla 3.0\. It's been an interesting journey and one that I hope with provide content for some articles, if only to help you avoid some of holes I fell into.

The reason for moving to Joomla 3 was two fold. One, I wanted to learn more about it so what better way than to upgrade your site. Second, I wanted to make some improvements to the site but those were not going to be easy under the Joomla 1.5 architecture.

Overall, the process has not been that bad. Joomla 3 certainly has a lot of nice things, but there some things have been changed which I don't think make sense for power users. 

## Restore User Feedback

I've missed the ability for people to comment directly on articles (and JPeople didn't quite work out as we hoped), so I've been working on a Disqus plugin, but one that you can configure through the article and category edit forms. This is why I needed to get off Joomla 1.5\. I'll be doing a blog about how this is done because it is extremely simple and more developers should use the technique.


I'm slowly working the bugs out of is and you can see the result on this site (so please test it out for me and let me know what you think).

## Add Upgrade Support to Joomla 2.5/3.0 Extensions

For those extensions I am releasing for Joomla 2.5 and 3, I want to put in place all the systems to allow them to be upgraded via Joomla's update manager.

So far I have been able to do that with my new [Artof Comments][0] extension and I want to write about that experience. It's a frustrating experience but once you are all set up, the overhead reduces.

## Change Learn the Art of Joomla from a Subscription to a Sponsorship Business Model

I am very grateful to those people who have subscribed to my advanced technical content. However, to produce good video material at the moment is just not sustainable with the spare time I have available (it takes between 60 and 90 minutes to produce each minute of video) - and I still have much I want to write about. So, and inspired by [Cocoate][1], this year I'm going to move from a private subscription model and expose all that content to the public and sell sponsorship slots at various levels. Overall I think that will be a win-win for everyone because I hate that only the people who have paid can receive a benefit from my content. If you have any thoughts about what levels of sponsorship could cost, or you are interested in the prospect of sponsoring, let me know.

## Blogging More Regularly

The updates on this site have been few and far between in the last year. I would like to change that.

My plans are to blog about how I've set up this site and my extension tool chain. I'll also hope to provide some more technical tutorials on Learn the Art of Joomla during the year that would interest both Joomla CMS and Platform developers.

Well, that's it for now and if I achieve all that in the year I will be very happy. Hopefully there will be time to do more but we'll see. If you have your own thoughts, by all means let me know.

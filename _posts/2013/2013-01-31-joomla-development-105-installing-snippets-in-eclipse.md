Following on from the second article in this section, [Development Tools][0], and after upgrading Eclipse to Juno, I found that most of the standard distributions of Eclipse don't come with the snippets plugin installed anymore. The following slide tutorial outlines the steps to install the snippets plugin, part of the common elements of the [web development tools][1] package.

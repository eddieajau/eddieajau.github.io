Without a doubt, CKEditor is the best editor to use with Joomla. Version 1.0.6 of Artof Editor is now available for download from [http://www.theartofjoomla.com/extensions/artof-editor.html][0] and supports Joomla 1.5, 2.5 and 3\.

This update includes CKEditor 3.6.2 and it brings the downloadable version into line with what was in the code repository. My next steps for Artof Editor are:

1. to upgrade Artof Editor to CKEditor 4, and
2. to include update-server support so that you can upgrade Artof Editor from within the Joomla Administrator.

To be perfectly honest, I would have updated to CKEditor 4 had they not changed the way they package CKEditor itself. I need a little more time to investigate the changes.

In this version, there is a known cosmetic issue with Joomla 3\. The styling of the buttons under the editor pane (for example, the Read More button) are being stripped of their styling. I'm still investigating why.

This version will also be the last available for Joomla 1.5\. Going forward I will only be supporting the version 2.5 and 3 series of Joomla.

Joomla 3.2 introduces the ability to save a history of the changes made when editing an article. The following guide walks you through this new feature.

At a glance, content versioning includes the following features:

* Enabled or disable article content versioning (find it under the Articles component options).</li>
* Set the maximum number of versions to keep.</li>
* Compare two versions and see the differences with or with the HTML code.</li>
* Keep any of the versions forever.</li>
* Delete any of the versions.</li>
* Restore any version (the version restore is the one that you edit and the one that will be displaying on your site).

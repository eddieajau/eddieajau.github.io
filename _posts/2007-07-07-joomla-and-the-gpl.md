After a very long and sometimes heated debate on the Joomla! Forums, Joomla! [recently clarified](http://www.joomla.org/content/view/3510/1/) it's position on how the GPL, the license under which Joomla! is released, affects third-party extensions. To cut a long story short, extensions are considered derived works in terms of how extensions inherit the parent license of the system.

New Life in IT fully supports the direction Joomla! has taken because it believes that the need to keep the GPL outwieghs the need for others, including us, to have the right to be able to release proprietary code for Joomla!. As such, we have decided to **endorse** the fact that New Life in IT will be using a **commercial GPL** model to release our flagship commercial extensions. These are **RokZine**, an industrial strength magazine style component, and **Things**, a very flexible catalog system. Various incarnations of these product have long formed the backbone of our consulting projects and we are working towards retail versions that will be distributed through our partnership with [RocketWerx](http://www.rocketwerx.com/). More information will be available on these two products very soon.

Our [FAQ](/terms-and-conditions.html) page has been updated to explain how our software, and it's license, will work.

We will also continue to support our free (as in free beer) offerings as well which include the every popular [RokReporter](http://www.newlifeinit.com/component/content/) (we are taking calls for low-cost custom reports now) and some new projects in the works called **RokTodo** and **RokACL**. Stay tuned for more information on these project.
